# CloudBees Pipeline Policies

* [Pipeline Policies for CloudBees CI](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/pipelines-user-guide/pipeline-policies) allow organizations to enforce standards across Pipeline jobs.
* Pipeline Policies are centrally managed runtime validations that support both scripted and declarative pipelines.
* Pipeline Policies provide administrators a way to include warnings for or block the execution of pipelines that do not comply with certain regulatory requirements or best practice guidelines captured as policy rules.
* There are currently 4 supported policy rules:
  * **AgentTimeoutRule** - validates that a timeout period was set for tasks executed on agents.
  * **PausedActionTimeoutRule** - validates that pipeline steps that require an external condition must be defined within a timeout.
  * **PausedActionInAgentRule** - validates that a paused action step isnâ€™t executed on an agent.
  * **EntirePipelineTimeoutRule** - validates that a timeout period was set for the entire Pipeline execution.
* CloudBees CI provides [Configuration-as-Code support for Pipeline Policies](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/pipelines/pipeline-policies#_managing_pipeline_policies_with_configuration_as_code). There is also a [CLI for managing Pipeline Policies in bulk](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/pipelines/pipeline-policies#_managing_pipeline_policies_in_bulk).

# Labs - Enforcing Pipeline Timeouts with Pipeline Policies and GitOps for Pipeline Policies

* In the following labs:
  *  You will use CasC for CloudBees CI to create a Pipeline Policy that will require that all Pipeline jobs on your ***managed controller*** be configured with a 30 minute (or shorter) global timeout.
* The *Enforcing Pipeline Timeouts with Pipeline Policies* lab instructions are available at: 
  * https://cloudbees-ci.labs.cb-sa.io/module-1/pipeline-policies/

# Pipeline Policies Overview

* Used CasC to create a Pipeline Policy to enforce a minimum 30 minute global timeout for all Pipeline jobs on your ***managed controller***
* Updated the **CloudBees CI Configuration Bundle** template with a time out to validate successfully against the **Timeout policy** you created
