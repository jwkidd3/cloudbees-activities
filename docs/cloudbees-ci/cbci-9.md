### CloudBees SCM Reporting for GitHub 

* The CloudBees SCM Reporting plugin supports detailed commit statuses for GitHub and BitBucket. 
* As the build runs, CloudBees CI will surface actionable build information directly in your source control tool, in real-time, alleviating the need to switch over to your CloudBees CI ***managed controller*** to get an overview.
* Integrates with GitHub Checks - as seen below.

# CloudBees Slack Plugin

.img-right[
* Similar to the CloudBees SCM Reporting plugin, the CloudBees Slack plugin provides actionable build information as Slack messages.
* After a build runs *for a GitHub Pull Request*, the CloudBees Slack plugin will surface results about the build directly in Slack, alleviating the need to switch over to your CloudBees CI ***managed controller*** (Jenkins instance) to get an overview.
* The Slack messages are sent directly to individual users based on who committed the code that triggered the CloudBees CI job.
