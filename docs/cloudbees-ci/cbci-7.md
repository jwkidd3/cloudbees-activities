# Pipeline Template Catalogs

Pipeline Template Catalogs provide version controlled parameterized templates for Multibranch and stand-alone Pipeline jobs, and help ensure that Pipeline jobs conform to organizational standards.

Benefits of using Pipeline Template Catalogs include:

* Providing developers with a simplified and directed experience for configuring Pipeline in “domain specific” terms that make sense for an organization. This allows developers to focus on shipping software.
* Organizing Pipelines per projects and/or teams. Similar-looking jobs that only differ in a few aspects can be easily parameterized on a per job basis. When you change a template, all the jobs created from that template get updated automatically.


???
Pipeline Template Catalogs help ensure that Pipeline jobs conform to organizational standards and when used in combination with Shared Libraries provide reusable Pipelines — boosting cross-team collaborations, saving time and reducing errors.

Pipeline Shared Libraries and Pipeline Template Catalogs can 'live' in the same source code repository.
