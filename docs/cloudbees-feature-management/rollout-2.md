# Gating Code with CloudBees Feature Management

Feature Management allow you to put gates around new feature code.

* Flags are added to the source code of an application.
* A flag is then used to wrap the code of a new feature.
* There are SDKs that support both frontend and backend development.

# Introduction to Configuration Fetching
<br/>
In order to see our gated code on our example application, we need to know a few key pieces of information:
1. Has the flag value changed?
2. From where was the value change initiated?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can identify when Rollout SDK has loaded configuration from local storage or network by adding the `configurationFetchedHandler`. The `configurationFetchedHandler` returns `fetcherResult` which has the following information regarding the actual fetch:
* `fetcherStatus` - an enum that identifies which configuration was fetched (from the network, from local storage, an error occurred)
* `creationDate` - Date of configuration creation
* `errorDetails` - The description of the error if one exists
* `hasChanges` - Boolean `True` if the configuration differ from the one it is replacing

# Lab - Gating Code with CloudBees Feature Management

* In this lab, you will create a title component and add it to the **microblog-frontend** sample application. Since this component is *experimental*, we will gate it behind our previously created feature flag (`title: new Rox.flag(false)`) that will initially hide it.
* Using the CloudBees Feature Management dashboard, we will remotely configure the value of the flag, enabling the title.
* The *Gating Code with CloudBees Feature Management* lab instructions are available at:
  * https://cloudbees-feature-flags.labs.cb-sa.io/labs/feature/

# Gating Code with CloudBees Feature Management Lab Review

* You created an experimental component.
* You created a `show_title` function that returned the boolean value assigned to our `title` feature flag.
* You wrapped your experimental component in conditional logic to only display when `show_title` is `True`.
* You defined a `configurationFetchedHandler` and added it to your `options` to alert your application that a configuration value has changed and allowed for updated config values to be applied on an action (page refresh).
* You committed your code back to your `development` branch.
