# User Targeting

You may not always want everyone to receive the same experience when rolling out a new feature, or simply updating an existing feature. When working with a new front-end UX design, a back-end search improvement, or anything in between, targeting specific users can help ensure the best experience for all of your customers.
<br/>
<br/>
Target groups let you define groups of users based on one or more user properties or device attributes. CloudBees Feature Management also includes built-in targeting using the format
<br/>
`rox.<attribute_name>`.
<br/>
<br/>

Attribute Name | Notes
--- | ---
`rox.language` | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two letter language code, e.g., "en," "es," or "fr
`rox.platform` | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OS name, e.g., "iOS" or "Android"
`rox.screen_height` | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screen height in pixels
`rox.screen_width` | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screen width in pixels

# User Targeting Lab Review

User targeting is another important concept in CloudBees Feature Management. With this lab complete, you can now offer a different user experience based on known attributes and you defined a custom property `isLoggedIn`. In this case, our microblog now has an additional UI element for the users with an account compared to those who do not.
