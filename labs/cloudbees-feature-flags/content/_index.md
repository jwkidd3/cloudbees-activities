# CloudBees Feature Management Workshop

Put simply, feature flagging is a practice of wrapping new functionality in conditional code blocks.

Feature flags are used to hide, enable or disable features during runtime. With feature flags, a software feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for local testing and disable it for all other users. Feature flagging also provides an alternative to maintaining multiple feature branches in source code.

This technique offers many other benefits and will be discussed in greater detail in this workshop.
