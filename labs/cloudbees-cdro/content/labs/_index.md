# Completing the hands-on labs

The step-by-step labs are provided to introduce you to the key features and applications of CloudBees CD/RO. The instructions are self-contained and can be performed with no further background so that you can be successful right away.

The deployment examples make use of public content hosted on GitHub. These include a binary archive (.war file) and a Helm chart. Users only need read access to GitHub to download the .war file. The Helm charts are downloaded using a CloudBees-supplied configuration.

It is also recommended that you read the product features pages in the [CloudBees CD/RO documentation](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-cd/latest/) so you can get a practical understanding of the software. You can do this before or after you complete the examples.
