# Module 2: Release Orchestration

The Release module captures, executes, visualizes, and controls the life cycle of multiple application or microservice enterprise releases. Using the Release capability, outputs from multiple teams can be coordinated to produce a final release to be pushed to production. You can create a Release model consisting of multiple applications or microservices deployed on different systems, such as traditional, cloud, mainframes, and remote servers. You can then run the Release pipeline reliably and repeatedly until the software release is complete.
