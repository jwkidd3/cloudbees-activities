Releases are used to manage the tasks associated with releasing multiple applications or components together.

Perform these steps to create and run a CloudBees CD/RO release pipeline that does the following:
- Invokes the procedure
- Invokes the Tomcat and Helm Chart application models you created in earlier examples
- Implements manual and automated gates

## Create a new release
