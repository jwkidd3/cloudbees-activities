# CloudBees CI Pipeline Workshop

This workshop will provide a basic understanding of how to create and manage Jenkins CI/CD Declarative Pipelines leveraging developer focused features of CloudBees CI.

This repository contains instructions and learning materials for the workshop that is designed to teach the following key concepts:

  * How specific features of CloudBees CI on Kubernetes will accelerate your continuous delivery?
  * Why you should *mostly* use [Declarative](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) vs [Scripted](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) pipelines?
  * How reusable templates for Jenkins Declarative Pipelines can increase developer productivity?
  * What are the key features of Declarative Pipelines?
