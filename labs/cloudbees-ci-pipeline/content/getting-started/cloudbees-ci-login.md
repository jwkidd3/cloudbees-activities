CloudBees CI for modern platforms takes advantage of Kubernetes to providing dynamic provisioning of team specific Jenkins instances we refer to as ***managed controllers***. A CloudBees ***managed controller*** (Jenkins instance) was provisioned for you with an initial configuration provided by CloudBees CI Configuration-as-Code.

3. Click on the link of your CloudBees CI ***managed controller*** that will be in a folder having the same name (lowercased) as the GitHub Organization you are using for this workshop. ![managed controller link](managed-controller-link.png?width=70pc) 
4. NOTE: Depending on when you completed the pre-workshop setup, your ***managed controller*** may still be **Starting** as seen below. ![managed controller starting](starting.png?width=60pc) 
If that is the case you will have to wait until it is **Approved** and **Connected** as seen in the following screenshot. Once the **Status** is **Approved** and **Connected** click on the link for your Managed Controller. ![managed controller connnected](mc-connected.png?width=60pc) 

>NOTE: There are a number of ways to create a Managed Controller. We take a very opinionated way to provision attendees Managed Controllers for this workshop in order to pre-configure the components that you will interact with during the workshop, allowing us to jump into the content more quickly.
